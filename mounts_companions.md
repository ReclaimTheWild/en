Heroes may want to befriend animals, tame mounts, and even gain squires. This is only natural! While any living creature can be made a Hero’s Companion, doing so requires effort – and keeping them alive in a fight may require careful strategy. 

However, the benefits may be numerous. A Hero may be powerful, but they are still limited – only able to carry so many things, know so much lore, perform so many deeds. While Companions are almost always less powerful than a Hero, they can still aid their patron Hero and their allies in ways both mundane and arcane.

Heroes may also have temporary Companions: the knight pressed into following the Heroes, and keeping an eye on their activities; the traveler who wishes safe passage, and is willing to help the Heroes who are helping her; the noble prince, rescued from the tower, now trying to keep up and show that he’s more than dead weight. While they may not follow a Hero’s every order or have sworn an oath to them, these temporary followers may still need to fall under this umbrella if they journey with the Heroes for a long enough time.

Note that Heroes may only have one Companion with them at a time, barring short-term extenuating circumstances.

## Gaining a Companion

Heroes can only attempt to gain Companions that meet the following criteria:
- The target Companion-to-be must be alive, and able to hear or see the Hero.
- The target must not be currently actively hostile to the Hero. (You cannot attempt to gain a Companion mid-fight.)
- The target and the Hero have interacted for a while (at least an hour, if not more).

When presented with the opportunity for a Hero to gain a Companion, there are two ways a GM might resolve the situation:  
through roleplay, or roll-play.

In roleplaying the situation, the Hero(es) ask the potential Companion (played by the GM) to join them. They might attempt to befriend them, learn more about their motivations or their troubles, or discuss what makes them more alike than different. 

When roll-playing the situation, it all comes down to a die roll. The Hero must make a Command check, with a DC equal to **(10 + (Target’s Rank x 3))**. That roll is modified by the Hero’s actions towards the target in the past, and the target’s circumstances.

Regardless of how the situation is resolved, if the Hero succeeds – and both the GM and the Player feel it appropriate – then the would-be Companion is persuaded to join.

Roleplaying the gaining of a Companion is suggested for sentient or near-sentient companions, like kids, lesser adventurers, or (perhaps) whip-smart animals. Roll-playing is better suited for monstrous, animalistic, or very simple creatures – or simply if the GM and players both prefer to leave it to a Trait check, rather than their roleplaying ability.
