## Steps to Create a Character

The most important part of any legend is the Heroes who partake in it. As such, the first step in playing *Reclaim the Wild* is to decide what kind of Hero you want to be!

Character creation is tough! For some people, deciding who they want to play can be more difficult than fighting Ganon.

This chapter will go over the steps required to create a character. Some information you may need – such as details on Races, what each Trait can do, and lists of Feats, Spells, and Techniques – are contained in later chapters. While creating your character, you may need to refer to these later chapters.

Character Creation in *Reclaim the Wild* happens in seven steps, listed below.

1. Determine Concept
2. Select a Race
3. Purchase Traits
4. Select Starting Equipment
5. Buy Feats, Spells, and Techniques
6. Fill in secondary statistics
7. Determine Finishing Touches

## Determine Concep

The first step is also the most important:  
*What kind of character do you want to play?*

Typically, a character’s concept can be summed up in a quick, broad description: just a few words, or a sentence or two, at most. For instance, you might want to play “a fast-talking knight,” “a romantic herbalist”, or “a wizard who seeks acceptance.”

This concept helps determine what Traits, Feats, Techniques, and Spells you might want to purchase for your character. A “cunning warrior” likely wants to have a high Combat Trait, and strong interpersonal Traits like Guile and Influence, but might choose to ignore Willpower, Mechanics, or Nature.

Typically, most characters start as aspiring Heroes, just on the cusp of beginning to build their legend and make their mark on the world. This means that they are not yet storied, seasoned adventurers! Your character concept should leave plenty of room to grow *into* greatness.

You may want to consider what Race your character is at this stage, but it isn’t required. “An aspiring songstress” could be of any Race, for instance; you might decide to simply choose whichever Race catches your fancy, or one that has a statistical advantage for you.

Don’t worry too much about the other personal details at this stage. Things like the character’s name, age, and appearance will come at the end of the character creation process, as part of the Finishing Touches.

### Concept Pitfalls

In any tabletop game, it’s important to have a character that can work well with both the rest of the group, and with the GM’s intended setting and tone. When you come up with your character concept, you should think about how your character will interact with the other players *and* their characters, as well as how they’ll fit with the campaign’s tone!

Here, we’ve listed three common pitfalls that character concepts can fall into. If your character falls into one of these categories, you should talk to your GM, and see what you can do to help flesh them out, and to ensure that you (and the other players!) can still have fun with the game – or, you may want to consider working with a different character concept.

**Lone Wolves** might be a problem, because they’ll be more likely to split the GM’s attention when they go their own way, and less likely to want to participate in the events going on with the rest of the party. This can lead to the Lone Wolf’s player becoming bored and disconnected from events, and other characters simply forgetting about them entirely. If you want to play a loner character, be sure they have a reason to stick with the party, even when your character might prefer to be alone.

**“Evil” characters** might cause issue, simply because they’re going to do bad things that the other party members might object to – leading to the party fighting amongst themselves more often than they fight actual monsters. You can absolutely play characters with different sets of morals, and your character may have failings or even occasionally do mean things. However, we highly recommend you don’t try to be a bad guy in a group of do-gooders – nobody wants the fight of good against evil to come to blows around the gaming table.

**Incongruent characters** are those that just don’t fit the game or its world. A disillusioned veteran of a bloody war, for instance, might not fit into a world of simple “good vs. evil” morality straight out of a cartoon show.  
Conversely, an innocent, wide-eyed squire who believes in the power of friendship might not make sense in a world under the despotic thumb of an evil overlord. When these characters enter play, they often find that they just can’t handle the world as it was made; at best, they either adjust quickly (the innocent squire learning many harsh lessons very quickly); at worst, they may be shunned by the other characters in the group. When coming up with your character concept, don’t be afraid to talk to the GM, and ask “would my character make sense in your world?”

## Selecting a Race

The next decision in creating a character is also one of the simplest: what race are they?

A Hero’s race helps determine how they look, where they came from, and the kind of life they lived before they began their adventure. It also helps determine some of the things they are more naturally inclined towards; for instance, Gerudo are often skilled warriors, while Sheikah are more likely to know 
forgotten lore.

The Primary Races – Gerudo, Goron, Hylian, Rito, Sheikah, and Zora – are the most likely to be acceptable choices in your game world. These are the most common races in Hyrule, as seen in *Breath of the Wild*, and the most likely to go on a wide-ranging adventure.

The Secondary Races – Deku, Demon, Fairy, Subrosian, Talking Animal, and Twili – may or may not be available in your game world; be sure to consult with your GM before selecting one of these races for your character.

You can read more about the various races in *Reclaim the Wild* – who they are, what they represent, and what they’re skilled at – in [the Races chapter]().

## Purchasing Traits

Your Traits describe your character’s skills and prowess. All Traits start at 1 for free.

As an adventurer, burgeoning Hero, or a legend yet untold, **you have 80 Tokens of Heroism to spend across all 24 Traits, and can bring any Trait up to a maximum of 5.**  
This pool of Tokens can only be spent on Traits. This maximum is just at character creation; once you’re past that, you can go above that original maximum of 5.

You may spend Tokens of Heroism to increase a Trait by a single point. The cost is always equal to the number that the Trait will be rising *to* – for instance, if you wish to increase your Arcana Trait from 4 to 5, that costs 5 Tokens.

All Traits max out at 10 – a person’s body simply cannot contain more skill than that naturally, though the use of food, elixirs or equipment can increase it further.

See the [Character Traits]() chapter for more information on Traits and what they do.

### Trait Quick Purchase

Rather than buying your Traits one by one, you can instead use a Quick Purchase array. All of these arrays use all 80 Tokens exactly – just choose which Traits get which numbers!

**“Varied”** – Three Traits at 4, seven Traits at 3, nine Traits at 2, and five Traits at 1.

**"Jack of All Trades"** – Two Traits at 4, six Traits at 3, sixteen Traits at 2.

**"Ready to Learn"** – Twelve Traits at 3, ten Traits at 2, two Traits at 1.

**"Strength without Weakness"** – One Trait at 5, two Traits at 4, two Traits at 3, and nineteen Traits at 2.

**"Focused on Their Strengths"** – Three Traits at 5, two Traits at 4, two Traits at 3, five Traits at 2, and twelve Traits at 1.

**"Talented but Troublesome"** – Six Traits at 4, two Traits at 3, eight Traits at 2, and eight Traits at 1.

> ***Health, Stamina, and Magic***  
> Most Heroes should put some Tokens towards Health, and at least one of either Stamina or Magic. Even if you're aiming for a “glass cannon” character, it’s strongly recommended to put at least a few Tokens towards your Health! After all, nobody’s going to sing the praises of a Hero who fainted in pain after stubbing their toe on a table leg.

### That Last Remaining Point

If you purchase Traits without using a Quick Purchase array, you may end up with a few Tokens that you simply can’t find a good place for. If you find yourself in that situation, there’s a simple trick that might help you use up those last few Tokens:

- Find two Traits that currently have the same score: two 2’s, two 3’s, or two 4’s.
- Subtract a point from one of those two Traits, gaining back the Tokens.
- Increase the other Trait by 1, spending the Tokens you got back in the previous step, plus one. You now have exactly one less Token than you had before!

With this technique, you should be able to spend every last Token you have available for Traits at character creation. However, if you just can’t find any place that feels appropriate for your character’s Tokens to go, speak with your GM – with their permission, you can simply hang on to the Tokens left over, and spend them later, when you’ve acquired a few more. GMs should be careful, though, as this could be used as a long-term way to minmax in the hands of a less scrupulous player.

### Secondary Stats

Once you’ve determined your Traits, you’ll need to fill in your secondary stats. This includes your Health, Stamina, and Magic, how well you resist negative effects, how far you can Jump, and how much you can Lift.

See the [Secondary Stats]() section in the next Chapter for more information on how to fill in these numbers.

### Movement Types

All Heroes begin play able to walk and swim. They are Natural Walkers, meaning that they can move 6 squares on foot in a single round of combat. All Heroes are also (non-Natural) Climbers and Swimmers, enabling them to tread water or clamber up cliffs, but moving half as quickly as they would on land.

Depending on your Race, you may be able to swim better than most, or even fly in the air!  
Be sure to note these movement types down.

See the [Movement]() section for more info.

## Selecting Starting Equipment

All Heroes start with a package of [Weapons](), [Armor](), and [Mundane Tools](). They may have:

- Two Rank 1 Weapons, or a Rank 1 Weapon and two Rank 0 Weapons, or four Rank 0 Weapons.
- AND, Two Rank 1 Armors, or one Rank 1 Armor and two Rank 1 pieces of Clothing, or four Rank 1 pieces of Clothing.
- AND, Two Rank 1 Mundane Tools, or one Rank 1 Mundane Tool and two Rank 0 Mundane Tools, or four Rank 0 Tools. (2 Bombs may be substituted for a Rank 0 Tool, or 5 Bombs for a Rank 1 Tool.)

Heroes who begin with Ranged weaponry also start their journey with ammo. If you begin with any Rank 1 Ranged weapons, you also have 10 Arrows. If you begin with only Rank 0 Ranged weapons, you instead have 5 Arrows.

If you have a Feat that teaches you a Crafting Style, your Weapons may be made in that Crafting Style, unless the GM indicates otherwise. If your Hero has a backstory steeped in a particular race's culture, and your GM agrees, your initial weapons may be made in that race's Crafting Style as well.

Heroes start with a Pack for free, to carry their starting gear and anything else they find Packs have different Pouches for different kinds of items, as per the table below.

| Pouch Type  | Starting Slots |
|-------------|----------------|
| Weapons     | 5              |
| Consumables | 5              |
| Armor       | 3              |
| Tools       | 3              |
| Ammo Pouch  | 1              |
